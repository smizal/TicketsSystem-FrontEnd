## About this ticketing system

This ticketing Management System is a simple online support ticketing system which provides the basic main tools and features needed to run client support tickets requests for business. It is made to provides a simple, step-by-step ticketing process along with a simple backend administration and customer dashboard to track his tickets.

## Intro to my system

With the basic functionality on the system, customers in frontend can submit tickets to specific department in any registered companies, they can keep track with any updates to their submitted tickets, view, read and add comments to any tickets that made. In backend company staff in the department can interact with the tickets and close. the company admins can add departments and staff users to the company. the super administrator can also add and view companies.

Although there are some things we was not able to implement them - for any reason - we can add some more features and ideas in future.

_Some suggested examples of improvements/ideas for the game:_

- Implement a functionality to send messages/emails to users in email, SMS or whatsapp.
- Implementation the reports section for (tickets reports by customer, agents, departments, dates or status ... etc).
- Implementing the search functionality in backend for fast review.
- Re-design the system showing to best practice GUI.
- activate the functionality of companies subscriptions.
